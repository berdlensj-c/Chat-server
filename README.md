# Chat-server
This is a chat server that I made for my web development class. It was initially using polling to work but changed to web sockets 


run npm install in directory then you can follow the links printed on the console.

Every message sent will be public unless prefaced with "name_of_user:" before sending the message can send multiple private messages at once by using comma after the username "username1,username2:"
